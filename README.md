Our project's goal is to create a more inclusive video game culture. Our application does this by allowing users to create teams for multiplayer games BEFORE starting play. This solves at least one problem: that novice and casual gamers get defeated by more experienced gamers immediately after entering the game, since they do not have a team to protect and back them up. Currently, players may form teams within the game, but are only able to form teams after entering the game, which requires skill to survive for long enough to go through the process of forming a team. With this TeamXMatch application, we allow casual gamers to team up for protection, and perhaps thus not get "killed off" as swiftly when they game. This can lead to players being able to grow and develop with other players, and it can also highlight the power of teamwork, which is important both in the virtual world and the real world. We hope to give the underdogs a greater chance in the gaming environment.
