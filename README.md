Our project's goal is to create a more inclusive video game culture in Montreal. Our application does this by allowing users to create teams for multiplayer games BEFORE starting play. This solves the problem of novice and casual gamers getting defeated by more experienced gamers immediately after entering the game since they do not have a team to protect and back them up. Currently, players are only able to form teams within the game, which requires skill to survive for that long. In doing this, we allow more casual gamers to not get discouraged and disappointed when they game. This will lead to players being able to grow and develop with other players, and also highlight the power of teamwork, which is important both in the virtual world and the real world. We hope to give the underdogs a chance in the gaming environment.
